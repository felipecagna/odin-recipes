        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
            </li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
            </li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
            </li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic
            </li>
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth
            </li>
            <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream
            </li>
            <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
